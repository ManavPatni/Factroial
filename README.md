Python Program to Find the Factorial of a Number
In this article, you'll learn to find the factorial of a number and display it.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

                            * Python if...else Statement
                            * Python for Loop
                            
The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.

For example, the factorial of 6 is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.
